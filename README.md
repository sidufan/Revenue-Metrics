# Revenue-Metrics
The Revenue Metrics Dashboard is a data visualization project designed to analyze financial flows and key metrics for a project. This dashboard provides insights for (fictional) product managers to track revenue dynamics and conduct high-level analysis of factors affecting these changes. The project emphasizes advanced data querying and visualization techniques for business decision support.

The dashboard visualizes key metrics like Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), Paid Users, Average Revenue Per Paid User (ARPPU), New MRR, Churned Revenue, and other essential financial indicators. Five carefully crafted charts offer a comprehensive view of user behavior and revenue trends, including comparisons of new and churned users, revenue expansion/contraction, and MRR contributions. Additionally, filters for date ranges, user age groups, and preferred languages provide flexibility for customized analysis.

Strategically, this project aims to support better decision-making by identifying revenue growth drivers and optimizing business processes. Students working on this project gain practical experience in financial analysis, SQL querying, and creating actionable dashboards in tools like Tableau, enhancing their data analytics skills.

This dashboard also includes key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Average Lifetime Value (LTV), Customer Lifetime (LT), and Paid Users Count, offering a comprehensive toolkit for monitoring financial health.
